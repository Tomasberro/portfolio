                        I'm a full-stack developer with two years of experience.<br /><br />
                        My strength is front-end development with React, and back-end with Node js, 
                        since it is what I have worked with the longest.<br /><br />
                        In my last experience I participated in a software factory developing functionalities such as payment system, authentication, crm systems, ecommerce and shopping cart. 
                        The technological stack that I used was Next js, Remix js, Mongo db, prisma, Node js, Redux and Css.
